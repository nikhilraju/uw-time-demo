# uw-time-demo

## Instructions
You might face problems with resolving the dependency on uwtime-standalone which depends on spf
I suggest adding the spf jar locally or through an internal repository management system

## Description
Quick stab at demonstrating time entity detection and resolution using a semantic parser based approach.

## Next steps
* Add lexical entries specific to your domain
* Use [Lexical Generalization] (https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~lsz/papers/kzgs-emnlp2011.pdf)
* The model can be tuned for higher precision or recall depending on what's more important for the domain
